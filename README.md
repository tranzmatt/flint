# ***Flint***
- Flint is a secure, local-first knowledge base with markdown notes, linked-note navigation, a visual graph, an infinite canvas, and optional AI assistance through local services.

## Install

Linux and macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chintanpatel24/flint/main/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chintanpatel24/flint/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer builds Flint from source, installs an Electron desktop runtime, adds the Flint logo to the app entry, and creates a launcher. Flint opens as a desktop application, not as a browser-hosted local web page.

Requirements:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm
- Python 3 for the optional AI agent
- Ollama for local model chat, for example `ollama pull llama3.2`

## Features

### Notes

- Markdown editor with live preview
- Wiki links with `[[Note Name]]`
- Tags with `#tag`
- Auto-save
- Split editor and preview mode
- Formatting toolbar
- Daily notes

### Canvas

- Infinite board for visual thinking
- Text cards, note cards, image cards, and frame groups
- Drag-to-connect lines with color controls
- Auto-rendered links between note cards
- Zoom, pan, undo, redo, and card context menus

### Graph

- Interactive force-directed note graph
- Node sizing by connection count
- Drag, zoom, pan, search, and depth filtering
- Curved edges between connected notes

### AI Agent

- Optional local Python agent
- Uses your notes as memory
- Can read graph connections for more context
- currently Works with Ollama only
- Can search Wikipedia when internet access is enabled
>- under development 
- Note-editing actions for supported requests

### Local First

- Notes stay on your device
- Vault data is stored locally
- Folder vault support for local workspaces
- No cloud account required

>## Development
>```
>git clone --single-branch --branch <branch-name> https://github.com/Chintanpatel24/flint.git
>```

Installer scripts:

- `install.sh` supports both local installs and the `curl ... | bash` one-liner.
- `install.ps1` supports both local installs and the `irm ... | iex` one-liner.
- `install.bat` is a compatibility wrapper for `install.ps1`.
- `uninstall.sh` removes the Linux/macOS install created under `~/.flint`.

## Aim

- [ ] Local models can use your notes, graph links, and optional internet search to answer questions.
- [ ] The Flint agent can update notes when you ask it to perform supported edit actions.
- [ ] Flint can manage notes and task workflows inside your selected vault.

> This project is under active development. Issues and pull requests are welcome, especially for desktop packaging, vault reliability, AI tools, canvas workflows, and accessibility.
